# Card Checker Web Application Deployment Guide

This guide will help you deploy the Card Checker Web Application built using Flask to a production environment. We will be using Heroku as our deployment platform.

## Deployment Prerequisites

Before starting the deployment process, make sure to:

1. Create an account on Heroku: https://www.heroku.com/
2. Install the Heroku CLI: https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install

## Deploying the Application

1. Clone the Card Checker Web Application repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `heroku login` and follow the instructions to log in.
4. Initialize a new Heroku app by running `heroku create <app-name>`.
5. Set the required environment variables: `heroku config:set SECRET_KEY=<your_secret_key>`
6. Update the `requirements.txt` file to include the necessary dependencies for Heroku.
7. Commit any changes made to the application code and configuration files.
8. Deploy the application by pushing to Heroku: `git push heroku main`.

## Ensuring the Application Runs Smoothly in Production

1. Review the application logs for any errors or issues: `heroku logs --tail`
2. Connect to the application using your preferred browser by visiting the following URL: https://<app-name>.herokuapp.com
3. Verify that the application functions as expected in a production environment.

## Troubleshooting Common Deployment-Related Issues

1. If the application doesn't start, review the logs for any errors or missing configuration settings.
2. If the application isn't connecting to the database, ensure that the correct environment variables are set, and the database connection string is accurate.
3. If the application behaves unexpectedly, review any code changes or configuration settings that may have been modified during the deployment process.

With these steps in place, the Card Checker Web Application should now be running successfully on Heroku. Update this guide as needed to address any issues that arise during deployment.
